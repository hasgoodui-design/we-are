# We are `hasgoodui.design` { style="text-align: center;" }

`hasgoodui.design` is a Domain used for pages listing questionable, stupid or even outright harmful Designs made by companies, services and alike.

Our main goal is not to attack those individuals, but to poke fun at them and show their mistakes.<br>
We also offer a site under the subdomain [`actually.hasgoodui.design`][actually-good]{ target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferral noopener" } which lists some actually good UI designs.

## Our Websites

A current list of our Sites under the `hasgoodui.design` domain can be found [on our GitHub Organization][org]{ target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferral noopener" }.

## Submitting Entries

Each site has a `Submit Entry` button that you can click on. It will redirect you to that site's issue tracker, where you can create a new issue to submit a new candidate to add to the site.
