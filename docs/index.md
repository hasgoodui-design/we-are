# We are `hasgoodui.design` { style="text-align: center;" }

`hasgoodui.design` is a Domain used for pages listing questionable, stupid or even outright harmful Designs made by companies, services and alike.

Our main goal is not to attack those individuals, but to poke fun at them and show their mistakes.  
We also offer a site under the subdomain [`actually.hasgoodui.design`][actually-good]{ target="_blank" rel="nofollow" } which lists some actually good UI designs.
